# Community-detection

1. **VNDS**: Variable Neighborhood Decomposition Search (VNDS)
is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. It is particularly effective for solving community detection problems by iteratively exploring the search space through local search and diversification strategies.

2. **LOUVAIN**: 
The Louvain algorithm is a powerful community detection algorithm widely used in network analysis. It efficiently identifies communities in large networks based on modularity optimization. This repository contains an implementation of the Louvain algorithm along with usage instructions, examples, and relevant documentation.

3. **DBSCAN Martingale**: 
(Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular clustering algorithm known for its ability to identify clusters of varying shapes and sizes in a dataset, based on density. The DBSCAN Martingale extends the traditional DBSCAN algorithm by incorporating a martingale-based stopping criterion, which dynamically adjusts the clustering process based on the distribution of data points in the feature space. This adaptation helps in improving the robustness and efficiency of DBSCAN, particularly in scenarios with varying densities and noise levels.
