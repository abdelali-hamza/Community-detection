# Metaheuristic VNDS Implementation

Welcome to the Variable Neighborhood Descent Search (VNDS) metaheuristic implementation! This repository contains Python code for VNDS, split across three main files:

1. **vnds.py**: This file hosts the core implementation of the VNDS metaheuristic. It includes the algorithm's components and functionality for optimization.

2. **graph.py**: Here, you'll find essential functions tailored for graph manipulation. These functions play a crucial role in representing and operating on the problem space effectively within the VNDS algorithm.

3. **utils.py**: This file provides a function specifically designed for loading synthetic datasets. These datasets are essential for testing and benchmarking the VNDS algorithm across various problem instances.

Additionally, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook file:

- **main.ipynb**: This notebook acts as the central workspace for testing the VNDS algorithm. It encompasses tests, experiments, and statistical analyses aimed at evaluating the algorithm's performance and behavior across different datasets and problem instances.

## Datasets

This repository also includes two folders containing necessary datasets:

1. **Datasets**: This folder contains datasets crucial for testing and benchmarking the VNDS algorithm. These datasets cover various problem instances and are essential for assessing the algorithm's performance. They represent the real datasets

2. **LFR**: Here, you'll find datasets specific to the LFR benchmark. These datasets are curated for evaluating community detection algorithms and can be used to test VNDS in community detection scenarios.

Feel free to explore and utilize these resources for your optimization needs! If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy optimizing!
