# Community-detection using louvain algorithm

A implementation of Louvain method on Python.
louvain-python implements community detection algorithm for large scale networks.
This package uses the Louvain method described in [Fast unfolding of communities in large networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0476). Vincent D. Blondel, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Renaud Lambiotte, Etienne Lefebvre.

Tests are included for real networks and synthetic networks generated by the LFR benchmark.
